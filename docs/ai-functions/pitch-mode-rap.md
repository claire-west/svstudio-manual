# Pitch Mode: Rap

"Rap" Pitch Mode will add AI-generated pitch deviations to your notes which are modeled to mimic human rap techniques, and allows the use of the Rap Intonation parameter.

## Enabling Rap Mode

Rap mode can be enabled for notes from the Note Properties menu. Notes using Rap mode will be red in the Piano Roll.

!!! info

    The pitch deviations introduced by Rap Mode are context-specific.

    A note's "context" is based on its pitch, duration, and phonemes, as well as those same properties of the notes before and after it. If any of these things change, the pitch deviations for the note will be recalculated.

Enabling Rap Mode also allows the use of pitch [AI Retakes](ai-retakes.md).
