# Pitch Transition and Vibrato

Transitions and vibrato are used to create a more natural flow between notes which does not adhere to the notes' exact pitch.

The selected Pitch Mode will determine which tools are available for modifying pitch transitions and vibrato.

## Pitch Modes

The Pitch Mode setting has three options, which can be selected from the Note Properties panel while at least one note is selected.

See [Editing Notes](../quickstart/editing-notes.md#selecting-notes) for methods of selecting many notes at once using hotkeys and modifier keys.

**Manual**
: Gives full manual control over the pitch. Notes will have no pitch deviation by default, so it is up to the user to enter the desired patterns from scratch. [More about Manual Pitch Mode](../advanced/pitch-mode-manual.md).

**Sing**
: Adds AI-generated pitch deviations to your notes which are modeled to produce realistic transitions, sustains, and vibrato. [More about Sing Pitch Mode](../ai-functions/pitch-mode-sing.md).

**Rap**
: Adds AI-generated pitch deviations to your notes which are modeled to mimic human rap techniques, and allows the use of the Rap Intonation parameter. [More about Rap Pitch Mode](../ai-functions/pitch-mode-rap.md).
