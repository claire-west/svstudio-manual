## Installation (Linux)

Navigate to your desired install directory and unzip the downloaded archive. If you are extracting to a location outside your home directory (`~`), you may need to run `unzip` as root (ie with `sudo`) such as in this example where SynthV Studio is being extracted to `/opt`:

=== "Pro Edition"
    ```
    cd /opt
    sudo unzip ~/Downloads/svstudio-pro-linux64.zip
    ```

=== "Basic Edition"
    ```
    cd /opt
    sudo unzip ~/Downloads/svstudio-basic-linux64.zip
    ```

If extracting to a location outside your home directory you may also need to modify the owner or permissions of the files. This example will work for most situations:

=== "Pro Edition"
    ```
    sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) "Synthesizer V Studio Pro"
    ```

=== "Basic Edition"
    ```
    sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) "Synthesizer V Studio Basic"
    ```

Launch the application by running the synthv-studio executable from the terminal.

=== "Pro Edition"
    ```
    cd "Synthesizer V Studio Pro"
    ./synthv-studio
    ```

=== "Basic Edition"
    ```
    cd "Synthesizer V Studio Basic"
    ./synthv-studio
    ```

If installing the Pro edition you will be prompted for your product activation code.

Once you have successfully installed the software (and activated it, if necessary) you will be presented with the following application window.

### Installing a Voice Database

To install a voice database, run the synthv-studio executable from the terminal and provide the .svpk file as an argument. The exact file name will vary depending on the voice database you are installing.

`./synthv-studio ~/Downloads/saki-ai-lite-install-101.svpk`

The application will launch and a voice database installation dialog will be displayed. Follow the on-screen instructions.

If installing a paid voice database product, you will be prompted for your product activation code.

Once you have successfully installed a voice database (and activated it, if necessary) it will be listed in the singer selection dropdown.

## Deactivating a Product

When you need to transfer your license to a new device, perform hardware/firmware upgrades, or reinstall your operating system, you must first revoke the license by deactivating the product.

To deactivate a product select it in the "License and Updates" panel and click the "Deactivate" button below. The activation on the current device will be revoked, and can be safely reactivated on the new or upgraded device.

!!! note

    Ensure that all voice databases are deactivated before deactivating or uninstalling Synthesizer V Studio. If you proceed with the uninstallation while activated voices remain on the system, you can recover the licensing status for the voices by reinstalling and reactivating Synthesizer V Studio.
