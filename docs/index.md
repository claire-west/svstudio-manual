# Synthesizer V Studio

<!-- ![Synthesizer V Logo](/img/synthesizer-v.png) -->

Synthesizer V Studio is a singing synthesizer released in July 2020, with AI synthesis functions added in December of 2020.

The software is developed by Dreamtonics in association with AH-Software, with compatible voice databases ("virtual singers") also created by licensed third-party developers such as Eclipsed Sounds.

??? abstract "Notice"

    Dreamtonics has released a comprehensive official user manual along with version 1.11.0 of Synthesizer V Studio. This unofficial manual has been updated to reflect version 1.11.0, but will no longer be maintained for future updates.

    Other unofficial resources, such as a [voice database buyer's guide](https://synthv.info/resource-voices#voices/ai) with purchase links for the various storefronts, will still be available at [synthv.info](https://synthv.info/).

    Please visit the [Official User Manual](https://svdocs.dreamtonics.com/en/home) for all future updates and information.

    Thank you for your support over the 16 months that I have worked on this project. I am happy that it is no longer needed.

## Navigating This Website

The user manual is separated into sections in order of complexity.

New users should start by reading the [Quickstart](workspace/layout.md) section in order before moving on to the more advanced topics.

Desktop users can navigate using the menu to the left, and mobile users can tap the three-bars (:fontawesome-solid-bars:) icon in the top left corner to open the navigation menu.

## Using the Search Function

If you are looking for information about a specific feature, the search function will often offer the fastest way to find that information.

Click on the "Search" text box in the top right of the page (or tap the magnifying glass icon on mobile) and type a keyword.

In some situations you will want to surround your search term in double quotes in order to prioritize results matching the exact phrase instead of just the individual words.
