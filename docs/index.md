## Using the Search Function

If you are looking for information about a specific feature, the search function will often offer the fastest way to find that information.

Click on the "Search" text box in the top right of the page (or tap the magnifying glass icon on mobile) and type a keyword.

In some situations you will want to surround your search term in double quotes in order to prioritize results matching the exact phrase instead of just the individual words.
