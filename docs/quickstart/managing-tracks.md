# Managing Tracks

Tracks are displayed in the [arrangement](../workspace/arrangement.md) panel.

## Creating Tracks

There are multiple ways to add a new track:

- Click the three-line icon to the left of the time axis
- Right click empty space below the existing tracks
- From the "Project" menu at the top of the application window
- Drag an instrumental (.wav or .flac) file into the arrangement

!!! note "Pro Feature - Track Limit"

    Synthesizer V Studio Basic is limited to 3 tracks. The pro edition removes this limitation.

!!! warning

    Using an instrumental file in mp3 format may result in desynchronized audio.

Notes from other tracks will be shown in the piano roll as colored lines. This can be disabled with the "Show Melody from Other Tracks" option in the "View" menu at the top of the application window.

## Importing Tracks

There are two options in the "File" menu at the top of the application that allow importing of tracks.

![Import Options](../img/quickstart/import.png)

"Import" will open the selected file as a new project in Synthesizer V Studio. "Import as Tracks" will create new tracks in the current project based on the selected file.

You can use these functions to load a MIDI file containing the vocal melody for your song, or to import a project file from a different singing synthesizer.

Supported file types are MIDI, UST, VSQx, VPR, and CCS.
