# Saving the Audio

The audio output can be exported to a wav file via the Render panel, accessible from the launch bar.

Give your files a name, select the tracks to render, and press "Bounce to Files" to export in wav format.

Additional format settings are also available, such as bit depth and sample rate.

!!! note "Pro Feature - Aspiration Output"

    Synthesizer V Studio Pro can isolate and export separate files for aspiration (the sounds produced by airflow). The aspiration can then be mixed differently in your DAW, or used as a reference when de-essing.

    Selecting an "isolated" aspiration option will remove the aspirant sounds from the main channel/file, resulting in a base file that only contains phonation (the sounds produced by the vocal cords). In this case the files must be recombined in the mixing process to have a complete result.
