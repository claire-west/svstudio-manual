# Entering Lyrics

![Note Lyrics and Special Symbols](../img/quickstart/note-lyrics.png)

### 1. Lyric Entry
Double click on a note to enter a lyric. Press ++enter++ or click outside the note to confirm, or press ++esc++ to cancel the change.

Pressing ++tab++ will confirm the change and advance to the next note, while ++ctrl+tab++ will move to the previous note.

### 2. Syllable Break
Use the plus sign (`+`) to distribute a multi-syllable word across multiple notes.

    It is generally best practice to not include more than one syllable per note. When working in English, use of the syllable break character is often critical to accomplishing the desired lyrical timing.

    When working in Japanese or Chinese there will generally only be one character per note, so syllable breaks are typically not necessary.

### 3. Legato
Use the minus sign (`-`) to continue the last sung vowel into the following note.

## Combining Syllable Breaks and Legato
Multi-syllable words and melismas may require a combination of syllable breaks (`+`) and legato (`-`).

In this example the word "amazing" has its three syllables extended across six notes.

|Note|Lyric/Symbol|Syllable|
|---|---|---|
|1|amazing|First|
|2|`-` (minus)|First (continued)|
|3|`+` (plus)|Second|
|4|`+` (plus)|Third|
|5|`-` (minus)|Third (continued)|
|6|`-` (minus)|Third (continued)|

## Adding Breaths
Breath notes can be added by entering `br` as the note's lyric (AI singers only).

## Adding Glottal Stops
Glottal stops can be added between notes by prefixing the following lyric with a single quote (`'`). A note containing just a single quote can be used to add a glottal stop at the end of a phrase.

## Adjusting Pronunciation

It is rare for human vocalists to sing every lyric with perfect enunciation, so the default pronunciation of the entered lyrics will not always produce the desired result.

After completing the Quickstart section it is recommended to familiarize yourself with [Phoneme Editing](../note-properties/editing-phonemes.md) in order to achieve your desired pronunciation where necessary.
