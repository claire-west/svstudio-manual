### 1. Lyric Entry
Double click on a note to enter a lyric. Press ++enter++ or click outside the note to confirm, or press ++esc++ to cancel the change.

Pressing ++tab++ will confirm the change and advance to the next note, while ++ctrl+tab++ will move to the previous note.

### 2. Syllable Break
Use the plus sign (`+`) to distribute a multi-syllable word across multiple notes.

### 3. Legato
Use the minus sign (`-`) to continue the last sung vowel into the following note.

## Combining Syllable Breaks and Legato
Multi-syllable words and melismas may require a combination of syllable breaks (`+`) and legato (`-`).

In this example the word "amazing" has its three syllables extended across six notes.

|Note|Lyric/Symbol|Syllable|
|---|---|---|
|1|amazing|First|
|2|`-` (minus)|First (continued)|
|3|`+` (plus)|Second|
|4|`+` (plus)|Third|
|5|`-` (minus)|Third (continued)|
|6|`-` (minus)|Third (continued)|

Breath notes can be added by entering `br` as the note's lyric (AI singers only).

## Adding Glottal Stops
Glottal stops can be added between notes by prefixing the following lyric with a single quote (`'`). A note containing just a single quote can be used to add a glottal stop at the end of a phrase.
