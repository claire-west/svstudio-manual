### 4. Launch Bar

## Workspace Navigation
Aside from using the scrollbars on the bottom and right borders, you can conveniently navigate in all directions using ++"modifier key"+mouse-wheel++ combinations.

|Shortcut|Description|
|---|---|
|++mouse-wheel++|Vertical scroll|
|++shift+mouse-wheel++|Horizontal scroll|
|++ctrl+mouse-wheel++|Horizontal zoom (mouse-centered)|

At the time of writing there is no support for vertical zoom.

The modifier key used for each of these functions can be customized in the Settings panel.

## The Status Bar
If the "Show status bar" option is enabled in the Settings panel, a status bar will be visible at the bottom of the application window.

The status bar shows contextual information depending on the current mouse cursor position.
