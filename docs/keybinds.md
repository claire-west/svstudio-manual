# Default Keybinds

Most keybinds in Synthesizer V Studio map directly to one of the functions accessible via the menus at the top of the application, and are labelled according to their location. Since [user scripts](advanced/scripting.md) also appear in the top menus, this means many custom functions can also be assigned a hotkey.

A function's associated keybind will be displayed to its right in dropdown and right-click menus.

Keyboard shortcuts can be modified at the bottom of the Settings panel.

## Default Keyboard Shortcuts

While all options under the top menus can be assigned a hotkey, only those that have a default keybind have been listed here.
