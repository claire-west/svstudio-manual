??? abstract "Diagram Consistency Guidelines"

    Diagrams should be consistent with the following:

    - 22pt Arial labels (black)
        - 16pt for longer text, though any long text should be part of the markdown body and reference a numbered label
    - 4px #FF0000 (red) lines and boxes
        - Where boxes would obscure important information, arrows can be used to indicate specific UI elements (4px red)
    - White margin/background
    - Labels are positioned to the sides or above/below, but not both within the same diagram
        - When labels are used, they should be placed in the margins, not overlaid on the application
        - The sides that do not contain labels may have a 10px white margin, but images with no labels at all should not have a margin unless they are side-by-side comparisons ([example](/ai-functions/ai-retakes/#pitch))
        - Labels may be staggered, but this should be avoided unless necessary ([example](workspace/arrangement.md))
    - Labels are numbered where appropriate, with corresponding text descriptions below the diagram
        - When labels are to the sides, numbering begins top-to-bottom in the left margin, then continues top-to-bottom down the right margin ([example](workspace/layout.md))
        - When labels are above/below, numbering begins left-to-right along the top margin, then continues left-to-right along the bottom margin ([example](workspace/arrangement.md))
    - Lines are vertical and horizontal where possible, and labels are not rotated
        - Arrows are vertical, horizontal, or at a 45° angle
    - All multi-layer base diagram files (non-flattened) are saved alongside the final png
        - These guidelines provide clear and readable diagrams, however if we change the guidelines later having the non-flattened files will mean we can just replaces the labels, lines, and boxes without needing to retake all the underlying screenshots
    - Any video demonstrations should either be short (a few seconds) or link to an official Dreamtonics YouTube video
        - You can use [Gyazo](https://gyazo.com/download) or a similar tool to record short clips
