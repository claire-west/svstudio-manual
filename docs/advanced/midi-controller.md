## MIDI Recording
To begin recording, click the record button in the transport controls located at the top of the piano roll or arrangement panel (whichever is focused by user input), or press the associated hotkey (default ++num-asterisk++).

You may also want to enable the metronome option to the left of the Play button.

Stop recording by pressing the record button again, the stop button, or by pressing ++space++.

After recording your melody, a dialog window will prompt for additional action.

"Snap to Grid" will quantize the note lengths based on the current grid snap setting.

"Smart Quantization" will estimate a grid snap setting appropriate to your recorded input, instead of using the current snap setting.

After pressing "OK", the note timings will be set to the appropriate lengths.

To leave the notes at their recorded timings, click "Cancel" to abort the dialog.

Snap to Grid and Smart Quantization can be executed at any time via the "Modify" top menu.
